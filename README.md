# STEM projects website

I am making a website so that i can more easily show my projects and prototypes.
I'm a high school student at the SHD in Belgium, and I am following a career path calles "STEM" (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics). We need to show our work and process, so I thought that it might be easier and more fun to make a site instead of using things like PowerPoint.
